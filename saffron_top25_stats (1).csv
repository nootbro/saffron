No significant difference in side effects versus placebo 	."
2,Saffron vs Fluoxetine for Depression – A head-to-head trial comparing saffron with an SSRI (fluoxetine) in depression.,40 adults with mild-to-moderate depression,Saffron stigma extract 30,mg/day vs fluoxetine 20,mg/day (6 weeks),Hydro-alcoholic extract of Crocus sativus L. versus fluoxetine in the treatment of mild to moderate depression: a pilot double-blind randomized trial,Noorbala A.A. et al.,J Ethnopharmacol,"2005	Saffron’s antidepressant efficacy was statistically equivalent to fluoxetine. Depression severity dropped similarly in both groups (no significant difference in HAM-D score improvement; F=0.13, p=0.71) 	, indicating that 30	mg saffron daily was as effective as 20	mg fluoxetine."
3,Saffron vs Imipramine for Depression – Saffron was compared to a tricyclic antidepressant (imipramine) in depressed patients.,30 adult outpatients with MDD (HDRS≥18),Saffron stigma extract 30,mg/day vs imipramine 100,mg/day (6 weeks),Comparison of Crocus sativus L. and imipramine in the treatment of mild to moderate depression: a pilot double-blind randomized trial,Akhondzadeh S. et al.,BMC Complement Altern Med,"2004	Saffron 30	mg/day was found to be as effective as imipramine 100	mg in reducing depression symptoms (no significant difference in HAM-D score improvement; p=0.09) 	. Imipramine caused more anticholinergic side effects (e.g. dry mouth, sedation) whereas saffron was better tolerated 	."
4,Saffron vs SSRI in Postpartum Depression – Assessed saffron as an alternative to fluoxetine for postpartum depression.,68 women (age 18–45) with mild-to-moderate postpartum depression,Saffron stigma extract 30,mg/day vs fluoxetine 40,mg/day (6 weeks),"Comparison of Saffron versus Fluoxetine in Treatment of Mild to Moderate Postpartum Depression: A Double-Blind, Randomized Clinical Trial",Kashani L. et al.,Pharmacopsychiatry,"2017	Saffron was non-inferior to fluoxetine. After 6 weeks, 40.6% of the saffron group vs 50% of the fluoxetine group achieved ≥50% reduction in depression score (HDRS), with no significant difference between groups (p=0.61) 	. Saffron produced similar symptom relief to the SSRI without additional adverse events 	."

Both parent and teacher ADHD Rating Scale scores improved significantly and to a similar extent in the saffron and Ritalin groups over 6 weeks (no significant difference, p=0.70) 	. Inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity sub-scores decreased in parallel in both groups 	. Side-effect frequency was similar, indicating saffron (20–30	mg) can match a stimulant’s benefits in children with ADHD."
27,Saffron as Adjunct in Adult ADHD – Combining saffron with stimulant medication.,50 adults with ADHD (from 2021–2022 trials),Saffron 30,mg/day added to methylphenidate vs methylphenidate alone,Combined saffron and stimulant therapy in ADHD,Hariri N. et al.,(Trial reports 2021–22),2022,"Combination therapy outperformed stimulant alone. When saffron was used alongside methylphenidate, ADHD symptom scores improved more than with methylphenidate by itself 	. Two clinical trials (2021, 2022) showed significantly greater reductions in ADHD rating scale scores with the saffron+MPH combo versus MPH monotherapy 	. This suggests a synergistic benefit, with the combo yielding superior control of symptoms."
28,ADHD and Sleep Benefits – Saffron’s impact on sleep issues often comorbid with ADHD.,Adolescents and adults with ADHD in clinical trials,Saffron (15–30,"mg/day), with or without stimulant co-therapy",Saffron for ADHD – sleep outcomes,(Findings summarized by Lopresti and colleagues),–,2022,"Saffron conferred sleep improvements in individuals with ADHD. In trials, both saffron and stimulants increased total sleep hours, but only the saffron-treated groups saw significantly faster sleep onset (better ease of falling asleep) 	. Participants on saffron (alone or adjunct) had better nighttime sleep quality than those on stimulant alone 	. Given sleep difficulties are common in ADHD, this suggests a unique advantage of saffron in this population."

(Review),Khaksarian M. et al.,Psychiatr. Times (Dovepress),2019,"A comprehensive meta-analysis concluded that saffron is as effective as standard antidepressant medications in MDD. Across 8 randomized trials, saffron produced depression symptom reductions statistically equivalent to SSRIs (e.g. fluoxetine) 	. Saffron also significantly outperformed placebo in these studies. This evidence base confirms saffron’s antidepressant potency is on par with conventional drugs, but with fewer side effects noted."
41,Safety and Tolerability – Adverse effect profile of saffron versus pharmaceuticals.,"Pooled observations from multiple RCTs (depression, AD, etc.)",Saffron 15–60,mg/day (monotherapy or add-on),"[Various trials: e.g., Akhondzadeh 2004; Akhondzadeh 2010]",–,–,2004–2018,"Across clinical trials, saffron has a favorable safety profile. Adverse events on saffron were generally mild and not significantly different from placebo 	. Notably, saffron caused fewer drug-related side effects than standard medications – e.g., less sedation and dry mouth than imipramine 	, and less vomiting than donepezil 	. No serious adverse reactions to saffron were reported even at doses up to 60	mg/day, highlighting its excellent tolerability in humans."
47,Fibromyalgia Symptom Management – Trial of saffron versus SNRI in fibromyalgia (pain & mood disorder).,61 adults with fibromyalgia (widespread pain and depression),Saffron stigma extract 15,mg/day + analgesics vs duloxetine 30,mg/day (8 weeks),Saffron (Crocus sativus) versus duloxetine for treatment of patients with fibromyalgia: A RCT,Mousavi S.H. et al.,Avicenna J Phytomed,"2018	Saffron showed comparable efficacy to duloxetine in fibromyalgia. Over 8 weeks, patients on saffron experienced similar improvements in pain intensity (VAS scores) and functional impact (FIQ scores) as those on duloxetine, with no statistically significant difference between groups (both groups improved significantly) 	. Depressive symptoms (HAM-D) also improved in both. Saffron was well-tolerated and tended to have fewer side effects (e.g., less nausea) than duloxetine. These results suggest saffron may serve as an alternative or adjunct in fibromyalgia management."
